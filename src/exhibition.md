## Join us for a day of exploration and inspiration at Sonic Forest, a groundbreaking event that merges art, science, and nature to raise awareness of forest ecologies. Set against the picturesque backdrop of Alice Holt Forest, this immersive experience created by 12 international artists is designed to engage families, art enthusiasts, environmentalists, and curious minds alike. Embark on a guided walk through the forest, where you will encounter a series of thought-provoking sound installations. These installations are not just art; they are a dialogue with the environment, using data collected from the forest itself to convey powerful messages about climate change, and contributing to its acoustic ecology.
