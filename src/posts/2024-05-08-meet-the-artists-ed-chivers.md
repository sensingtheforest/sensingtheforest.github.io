## How do you describe your practice?

I am a composer, performer and sound artist based in Brighton, UK. My work explores the interplay between the natural and technological worlds, such as using lightning strikes to generate musical patterns, and seismic activity. I am a member of the bands Fujiya & Miyagi, and AK/DK, with whom I tour internationally. I have composed music for contemporary dance, theatre, and short films.

## What are your influences, what inspires you?

I am currently inspired by the electromagnetic spectrum, both from the natural world and that generated by humans.

## Where are you based and what is your background in terms of education?

I am based in Brighton, South East England. I completed the Masters in [Sonic Arts at Goldsmiths](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/mmus-sonic-arts/), University of London. I am a guest lecturer at University of Brighton and External Examiner at Confetti, Nottingham Trent University.

## What does engaging with nature mean to you as an artist?

It gives us the opportunity to pause, listen, and become more aware of the world of sound around us.

## What does it mean to be selected for the summer school?

It's an amazing opportunity to connect with other artists from all over the world, share ideas, learn new things and create art that has a meaning. I grew up in the New Forest, but have lived in cities since - this is an opportunity to re-connect with the trees and wildlife.
