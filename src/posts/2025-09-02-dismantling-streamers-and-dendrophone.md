And the day arrived. Between Tuesday 26 August, 2025, and Monday, 1 September 2025, Luigi, Pete and I were able to dismantle the three installations: Dendrophone, installation streamer, and natural soundscape streamer.


It has been one year of exhibiting the Dendrophone sound installation by Peter Batchelor, as well as streaming and collecting audio data from the two streamers built by Luigi Marino. It has been an intense year; we had to learn on the way how to survive in the forest. And we made it. We ensured to leave zero human imprint. It feels like we successfully accomplished a big challenge rounding one year full of adventures.

As Pete says: 

> What remains are a few logs. Minimal disturbance.

It has been an amazing experience. We are thankful for all the constant help from Forestry England's Alice Holt Forest Team in the success of the project. We now need to complete the datasets of audio recordings and weather data. Additionally, we are planning to organise a final online meeting to debrief the project and hear back from the team on the impact of the project on the site.
