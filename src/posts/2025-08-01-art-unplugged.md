## Introduction

The inspiration for this project came from the Sensing the Forest project, which focuses on collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches to studying the relationship between forests and climate change. As I personally find this topic very important in terms of being a global issue, for my final year project I have decided to develop a project in that domain under pivotal supervision of Dr Anna Xamb贸 Sed贸.

## Aim

For years now, it has been very well documented how excessive electrical energy production highly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. With the very rapidly increasing interest and demand for immersive and digital art installations, we can see how energy usage proportionally rises. In order to counter this, this project aims to answer the question: **How can we devise a power solution to achieve selfsustainability of art installations, and how can we apply this knowledge in the art
industry?**

## Field Study

An initial step in carrying out my project was a site visit to the Alice Holt Forest,
specifically the *Dendrophone* installation by Dr Peter Batchelor and the *Streamers* by Dr
Luigi Marino. I had the pleasure to visit onsite in the company of my project supervisor Dr
Anna Xamb贸 Sed贸 where we also met Dr Peter Batchelor. Together, we were able to see
hands-on how the installations operate and their technical aspects. Dr Peter Batchelor
very kindly answered all of my questions regarding his work, and I was also then able to
interview him on site in an office space we booked for the day, courtesy of Forestry
England. The interview has been published on the Sensing the Forest website. This visit
has helped me study the theoretical background for my project and see how my topic could apply to existing real life installations. I believe that was an essential step to this
project in order to ground my research and findings in a real world context.
