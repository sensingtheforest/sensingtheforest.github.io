## Introduction

The inspiration for this project came from the Sensing the Forest project, which focuses
on collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches to studying the relationship between
forests and climate change. As I personally find this topic very important in terms of being
a global issue, for my final year project I have decided to develop a project in that domain
under pivotal supervision of Dr Anna Xambó Sedó.

## Aim

For years now, it has been very well documented how excessive electrical energy
production highly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. With the very
rapidly increasing interest and demand for immersive and digital art installations, we can
see how energy usage proportionally rises. In order to counter this, this project aims to
answer the question: **How can we devise a power solution to achieve selfsustainability
of art installations, and how can we apply this knowledge in the art
industry?**
