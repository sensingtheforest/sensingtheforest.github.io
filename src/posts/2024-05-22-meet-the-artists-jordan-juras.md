**About**: [Jordan Juras](https://jordanjuras.com/) is a Canadian-born, Berlin-based immersive artist, music producer, and audio researcher. He releases music under the aliases [PVAS](https://soundcloud.com/p-v-a-s), Available on Computers, and [NUG](https://boomkat.com/artists/nug-florian-tm-zeisig-jordan-juras) (together with [Florian T M Zeisig](https://floriantmzeisig.bandcamp.com/)). He completed a [Bachelors of Science in Physics at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-honours-physics) (2014), and a [Masters of Music in Music Technology at New York University](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/mm-music-technology) (2016) where he conducted research in personalised spatial audio and music information retrieval under Drs. [Agnieszka Roginska](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/agnieszka-roginska) and [Juan Bello](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/juan-pablo-bello). With experience gained as a Research Engineer at [Native Instruments GmbH](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/), he began to develop immersive experiences in 2019 with a practice that explores subconscious or invisible externalities and challenges the behavioral responses that shape our experience. He has created immersive works for the [Ultima Contemporary Music Festival](https://www.ultima.no/en/) (Oslo, 2021), the [Institute for Computer Music and Sound Technology at ZhdK](https://www.zhdk.ch/en/research/icst) (Zurich, 2021), and the [Screen City Biennale](https://screencitybiennial.org/) (Stavanger, 2019).


## How do you describe your practice?

I am a Canadian immersive artist, music producer, and audio researcher, with a practice that explores subconscious or invisible externalities and challenges the behavioral responses that shape our experience.

## What are your influences, what inspires you?

Spending time in nature, philosophy of science, experience, listening to cool music, friends!

## Where are you based and what is your background in terms of education?

I am based in Berlin. I did a Master of Music in Music Technology from NYU, NYC US, and a Bachelor of Science in Physics, McGill University, Montreal CA.

## What does engaging with nature mean to you as an artist?

Engaging with nature is a portal to engaging with our deepest selves. Synthetic demarcations between human and nature, and animate and inanimate matter obfuscates a lineage shared by all of Earth's substances. Life is a force that courses through animated matter, in a cyclical arc dependant on the inanimate - a state in which a host is ultimately left, ready to nurture the next; repeat ad infinitum.

## What does it mean to be selected for the summer school?

Participating in the summer school is an opportunity to develop and refine my current research interest, ‘Sound Gardening’: a conceptual frame to create immersive and interactive AR audio installations, which can re-centre urban dwellers in the natural environments within which our cities have grown.

As an initial focus, I am exploring the realm of “embodied musical instruments”, envisioned to animate and position trees and other Floral entities in a green space as collaborators within an audio-reactive music system. As a collaborator in musical experience, empathy can flourish and space opens for introspection in ways not possible outside of a musical dialog. Connection can be formed across spiritual and physical dimensions, bridging phenomenological and material distance through AR mediation.
