The first episode presents an interview with Anna Xambó Sedó (Principal Investigator of Sensing the Forest, Queen Mary University of London) conducted by Hazel Stone (National Curator of Contemporary Art, Forestry England), and six pieces of voice commentary recorded by summer school artists Ed Chivers, Kate Anderson, Gabrielle Cerberville, Austin Blanton, Miles Scharff, and Luigi Marino.

Thanks to all the artists for their invaluable and inspiring contributions!

The production of the podcast is carried out by Shuoyang Zheng, with the help and feedback from Hazel Stone, Dominic Head, Peter Batchelor, and Anna Xambó Sedó.
