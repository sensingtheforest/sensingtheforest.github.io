**About Bardia Hafizi**: Bardia finished his bachelors in Solid State Physics from Shahid Beheshti University in 2015. He briefly joined the masters program in Shiraz University in 2016, focusing on Complex Systems, before changing tracks to focus on his musical activities. 
Since 2002, Bardia has been playing the Persian goblet drum tombak in the traditional genres of music in Iran. He also started learning the string instrument setar in 2010, focusing on Classical Iranian repertoires as well as older Persian traditions. In 2019, he left Iran to enroll in the music program at the Center for Advanced Research in Music, focusing on the ethnomusicology of rhythm in Iran. In his masters thesis, Bardia traced a line of tradition of tombak and rhythmic performance in Iran -supervised by Dr. Robert O. Beahrs- from the oldest masters documented in the 19th century through the modernization period and the formation of Iran as a nation-state. Currently, he is doing his PhD in music at the same institute, focusing on sonic ecologies and critical histories.



## How do you describe your practice?

I am a multidisciplinary sound artist focusing on the phenomena of rhythm and time as expressions of multi-species interaction; repetition is an echo of kinship formed through years of cohabitation, sounding co-evolution and mapping aesthetic formation in this cycle we call life, from the first breath we take til the last of our kind. My practice is the poetic performance of soundscapes through 'ears' situated in different bodies, different locations, and different times.

## What are your influences, what inspires you?

I am inspired by deconstructing the concepts of 'listening', 'sounding' and 'nature' in multiple readings that exaggerate their political implications and simultaneously neutralizes the effect of modernity on multi-species empathy. My narratives, though stemming from universal crisis and end-of-world scenarios, are based on the idea of hope for the future and justice for all beings.

## Where are you based and what is your background in terms of education?

I originally hail from Tehran, Iran, where I learned traditional musics ad instruments. Currently I am based in Istanbul; I am in my first year of - education based- PhD program at the Center for Advanced Research in Music, Istanbul Technical University.

## What does engaging with nature mean to you as an artist?

Recently I have been contemplating the concepts of 'colonialism' and 'imperialism' and how they apply not only to the histories of peoples- versus-peoples, but of human-versus-nonhuman. Engaging with nature (however one defines it) for me is a humbling experience, constantly reminding me of how much destruction our species has brought to the world, a world which we ourselves cohabit.

## What does it mean to be selected for the summer school?

Unfortunately, as we have discussed before, I will most likely not be able to attend any of the sessions in person. This is both due to financial limitations -which could have been overcome- as well as my responsibilities as a PhD student; I'm afraid I will not be able to take the time off to travel to UK for the school as it coincides with our end of term and the various requirements that entails. However, I think I can bring a different perspective to the school through sensing the forest from a distance; contemplating communities in nature versus human communities, and how they -rhythmically- intersect with each other.
