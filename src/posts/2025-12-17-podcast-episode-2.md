During the Sensing the Forest Summer School, we had ten artists working on bringing their sound installation to the Willows Green trail at Alice Holt. The forest became an exhibition for visitors to walk, listen, and experience these artistic responses to climate change.

As the Sensing the Forest project is approaching an end, we created a two-episode podcast as an epilogue to share our stories along the journey of the summer school, and the sound installations presented in the [Your Sonic Forest exhibition](https://sensingtheforest.github.io/exhibition/).


As the Sensing the Forest project is coming to an end, it is our delight to share the second of a two-episode podcast as an epilogue of the Sensing the Forest project. 

The second episode continues the journey with an interview with the project co-investigator and composer Peter Batchelor, conducted by the artist and writer Chris Meigh-Andrews, to reflect on Dendrophone, a sound installation created by Peter Batchelor at the Alice Holt Forest. 

Thanks to Peter and Chris for their invaluable and inspiring contributions!
