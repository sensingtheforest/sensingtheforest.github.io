title: 13th Field Trip to Alice Holt Forest
date: 2025-01-20T08:00:00.000Z
excerpt: We went for a 13th visit to the Alice Holt Forest on 6 December 2024. The main goal of this field trip was to show the terrain to Alex while doing maintenance tasks for the streamers, introduce Alex to Pete for the interview about Pete's work, and brainstorm the design and content for a promotional leaflet.

## Getting familiar with the terrain and soundscape streamer maintenance

This field trip started with a regular visit to the soundscape streamer near the large pond. To our surprise, we found Giorgio a bit dislocated - we discussed several hypotheses with Alex and Pete: 1) natural forces such as strong winds; 2) human negative forces (Luigi had left a log in the front that had disappeared); and/or 3) human positive forces (all looked sheltered). The streamer has been working regardless, which "shows the robustness of the system" (quote by Pete).

In any case, Alex and I put two new logs laid in a triangular shape, set the two tripods upside up again and straighten again the dongle and the microphones. We also checked the angle of the light and the solar panel and raised it a little bit in accordance with what is expected in winter. George Xenakis told us that when the winter season arrives, the inclination/angle of the solar panels needs to be increased to capture the lower sun.

To check the angle of the solar panel we used the following link:

## Sound installation streamer maintenance and an interview with Peter Batchelor

We then moved to the Alice Holt Cafe to meet with Pete to then go to the Willows Green Trail to see the Dendrophone sound installation and Paula streamer. We did not touch the solar panels of the Paula streamer. It was working in the morning, we only updated the scientific poster with the correct QR code. In the last solo field trip, Luigi brought several logs together to keep the solar panels steady.

After lunch, Alex interviewed Pete about his work with solar power as part of his final BSc project. You can [read the interview with Pete here](/2025/02/08/an-interview-with-peter-batchelor/).

## Brainstorming session

We concluded the session with a brainstorming session in the Activity Centre to discuss potential ideas for the leaflet to promote Pete's installation/online exhibition and Luigi's streamers. Below you can find the result.

## Follow-up

The regular field trips to Alice Holt are necessary to keep the installations up and running. The forest can be harsh in the winter but we are learning so much on the way!

We will continue the field trips to improve the battery and exhibition conditions. We also hope to update the signage very soon.
