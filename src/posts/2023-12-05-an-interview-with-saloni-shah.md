## What are you working on at the moment?

Currently, I lead the product design team at nZero Inc., where our focus is on developing a platform empowering state and city governments to monitor emissions and create decarbonization roadmaps for their building portfolios. In parallel, I collaborate with local researchers and artists, exploring the potential of both traditional and emerging technologies for climate visualization.


## What is your background?

I began my academic journey with a focus on architecture, initiating my career by designing building systems and landscapes through the use of vernacular and alternative building techniques. Concurrently, I actively participated in conservation initiatives at one of UNESCO's world heritage sites in Ahmedabad, India. My involvement in urban conservation research and climate movements with nonprofits ignited a profound interest in climate change and data visualization. This passion drove me to pursue advanced education in the United States, where my [master's thesis](https://salonishah.co/money-or-mitigation/) delved into the impact of carbon markets and policies on forests. Since then, I've actively collaborated with various organizations, contributing my skills to design apps, XR experiences, and research visualizations dedicated to climate education.


## How did you start/become interested in producing visualizations informed by science and technology?

In 2019, I seized an opportunity to collaborate with [Ms. Alka Palrecha](https://www.peopleincentre.org/about-us/team/) on her research, which centered around the utilization of wastewater in agriculture. Despite lacking prior experience in working with data or scientific research, Ms. Palrecha believed in my potential and facilitated the creation of my very first scientific visualization. This initial experience marked the inception of my journey into designing visualizations for research. Building on this foundation, my work at the nonprofit Paryavan Mitra further propelled me on a trajectory exploring the realm of data visualization for ecological and social research.

## How is your artistic/scientific work generally perceived? Have you encountered any unexpected impact or reaction from your work?

I've been incredibly fortunate that my work has received overwhelmingly positive feedback. It not only establishes a unique space but also stands as an exemplar of leveraging design to showcase complex research. Frequently circulated within local environmental communities for policy education, it plays a crucial role in raising awareness. One of the most fulfilling impacts of my work is its role as a reference for students, inspiring them to explore their own mediums and niches in research.

## What is the meaning of community in your work?

The concept of community holds profound significance in my work, representing an intersectional movement where every individual contributing to positive change becomes an integral part of the collective. My journey has been marked by the privilege of collaborating with diverse groups, spanning from dedicated researchers to frontline activists, fostering and nurturing a dynamic and interdisciplinary community. This collaborative spirit has not only enriched the diversity of perspectives but has also cultivated an environment where collective efforts lead to meaningful and impactful contributions within the broader context of positive change.

## What are the artistic, technological, or scientific research methods that inform your work? To what extent (and how) is audio/sound/music relevant to your work?

The foundation of my creative process encompasses diverse elements, including artistic, technological, and scientific research methods. Commencing with data collection, I predominantly utilize secondary data sources, occasionally incorporating firsthand collection for specific projects. Subsequent stages involve meticulous data cleaning and in-depth analysis, coupled with the integration of qualitative information to construct a coherent narrative that resonates with the audience.

In the realm of immersive experiences, audio holds a pivotal role, especially in my XR and VR collaborations. Sound serves as a dynamic component, contributing to the overall richness and depth of the experience. Whether it's the subtle nuances of nature in a virtual environment or the incorporation of music to evoke emotional responses, audio enhances the immersive quality of the visual narratives, creating a multisensory engagement for the audience. This deliberate integration of sound underscores the holistic approach I employ to captivate and resonate with audiences on a profound level.

## To what extent do you see your work, and more extensively, the use of artistic methods, contributing to raising awareness of global crises such as climate change?

The significance of my work, and more broadly, the utilization of artistic methods, lies in its impactful contribution to raising awareness of global crises, particularly climate change. As the intersection of design and science takes center stage, with data becoming pivotal in environmental efforts, a symbiotic relationship emerges. Science, through meticulous data analysis, shapes global policies and directs developmental trajectories. Concurrently, design assumes a pivotal role in the education of diverse populations and decision-makers.

The transformative power of data visualization extends well beyond its role in policy changes. It becomes a catalyst for empowerment, providing communities with informed perspectives. By translating complex scientific data into visually compelling narratives, my work aims to bridge the gap between technical intricacies and public understanding. In doing so, it fosters a broader and more inclusive conversation, fostering a collective understanding of the urgent need for action in the face of global environmental challenges.

## How is technology impacting your work? Do you see technology shaping your creative process or the other way around?

The influence of technology on my work is transformative, serving as a dynamic medium for crafting impactful designs. Rather than technology dictating my creative process, I've embraced it as a tool to enhance and expand my design thinking. This evolution involves a proactive exploration of new mediums as they emerge, adapting my approach to leverage their unique capabilities.

My collaborations span a spectrum of projects, encompassing static visualizations, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and extended reality (XR). Each medium is strategically chosen based on its ability to convey a specific narrative, amplifying the educational impact. By seamlessly integrating technology into my creative process, I ensure that the chosen medium aligns with the intended message, creating immersive and engaging experiences that transcend traditional boundaries.

## How do you see creative AI impacting your practice/work? Is this a topic that interests you or worries you?

While my experience with creative AI remains limited, I approach its potential impact on my practice with a sense of cautious optimism. The application of AI holds the promise of enhancing and expediting critical aspects of my work, particularly in the realms of data cleaning and bias validation. Leveraging AI in these processes has the potential to significantly improve the overall effectiveness of climate research visualizations, ensuring a more accurate, unbiased, and streamlined approach to conveying complex environmental narratives.

However, I maintain a level of concern regarding the potential for unforeseen implications, particularly in the generation of enhanced bias and information. As the integration of AI into creative processes evolves, ethical considerations and the responsible use of this technology remain at the forefront of my awareness. Balancing the benefits with potential challenges, I remain open to exploring the possibilities while maintaining a vigilant and thoughtful approach to ethical considerations in the ever-evolving landscape of creative AI.
