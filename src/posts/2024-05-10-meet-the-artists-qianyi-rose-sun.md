**About Qianyi Rose Sun**: [Qianyi Rose Sun](https://roseqsun.myportfolio.com/) is currently pursuing her master's degree in [Music Technology at Georgia Tech](https://gtcmt.gatech.edu/), where she is an active member of the [Computational and Cognitive Musicology Lab](https://ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/). Her current research centers on developing interpretable evaluation metrics for AI-generated music, drawing from principles in music theory and perception. As a traditional Chinese Guqin player, she loves to explore how technology can facilitate the composition and consumption of understudied music traditions. Her broad interest in music and engineering has led her to various projects in robotics, computational ethnomusicology, digital signal processing, and interactive systems. She serves as the President of [Women in Music Tech](https://womeninmusictech.gatech.edu/), where she fosters a supportive community for women to exchange knowledge, build connections, and thrive in this dynamic field.


## How do you describe your practice?

I work at the intersection of musicology, artificial intelligence, and data science, with a mission to make creative practices more inclusive. My current research centers on developing interpretable evaluation metrics for AI-generated music, drawing from principles in music theory and perception. I am also a traditional [Chinese Guqin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin) player, and a flautist with a repertoire in classical, rock and pop, and experimental music.

## What are your influences, what inspires you?

Broadly speaking, my passion for music, culture, and community constantly inspires me to strive to be a better researcher and human-being. Music is not just a backdrop for my life but also the very core of my research, guiding me to explore and represent my own cultural heritage alongside other understudied music traditions. This journey of exploration is supported by the vibrant community around me, which serves as a constant reminder of the impact of my work.

Specifically, it's the female music scholars before me, my mentors in the music technology field, and perhaps [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://www.linmanuel.com/). I am continually inspired by the myriad female music scholars who have illuminated the path and showcased the endless possibilities within the field. Their legacy fuels my commitment to contribute meaningfully. My mentors in the music technology field guided me and helped me grow, both in research and creative pursuits. Lin-Manuel Miranda's theatre work and his dedication to representing his community remind me of the significant role that art can play in community, identity, and change.

## Where are you based and what is your background in terms of education?

I am currently based in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, where I have spent 6 wonderful years in pursuit of a B.S. and an M.S. in Music Technology from Georgia Institute of Technology. I will (finally) be moving on to pursue a PhD in a music related field later this year.

## What does engaging with nature mean to you as an artist?

To me, it signifies venturing into an uncharted realm where mother nature becomes both a muse and a collaborator, offering boundless sources of wonder and insight.

It is definitely a new avenue in my creative research, but it surely will enrich my artistic vocabulary, and allow me to find novel and meaningful ways to contribute to the conversation of environmental consciousness. It is an invitation to see the world through a lens of awe and responsibility, and a chance to bridge music, technology, and the environment.


## What does it mean to be selected for the summer school?

It is such an honor and truly means the world to me. I have never before participated in a project of this nature, particularly in environmental research and installation design. The lack of direct experience in these areas makes the selection even more meaningful. I am eager to learn from the esteemed scholars and talented peers. I am wholeheartedly committed to making the most of this opportunity.
