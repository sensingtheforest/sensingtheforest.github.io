[REVEIL](https://soundtent.org/reveil.html) is an assemblage of live audio feeds provided by soundcamps, streamers of the [Acoustic Commons](https://acousticommons.net) network, open microphones on the Locus Sonus soundmap, and live sound sources collected for this event.

The 12th edition of the Reveil broadcast will take place on Dawn Chorus Day, over the first weekend in May. The London soundcamp will be located at [Stave Hill Ecological Park, Rotherhithe](https://www.tcv.org.uk/london/urbanecology/urban-ecology-sites/stave-hill-ecological-park/).

The broadcast will start at **5AM London time (UTC+1) on Saturday 3 MAY to 6AM on Sunday 4 MAY 2025**. You can listen to the broadcast here: [soundtent.org/reveil](https://soundtent.org/reveil/)


The selected streams (each with their own page) appear on the schedule here:

We are happy to announce that the Sensing the Forest project will contribute to the event this year with two streamers located at the Alice Holt Forest: the Soundscape streamer and the installation streamer.
