The [CHIME Annual One-day Music and HCI Conference 2024](https://www.chime.ac.uk/chime-annual-conference-2024) took place on Monday 2 December 2024 at The Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK. This is a one-day research event for sharing work in the area of music and human-computer interaction, with a particular emphasis on participative hands-on demos. This is an opportunity to hear the latest research in music and interaction; network with peers; get hands-on experience with participative demos; and share your work and interests with representatives from music-interaction-related industry and charities.

Luigi presented the development of the streamers and the challenges that we are facing. It was nice to present the status of the streamers to the CHIME network after our [CHIME seminar one year ago on November 2023 about the Sensing the Forest project](/2023/11/01/presentation-at-chime-october-25-2023/).

## About the talk

**Title**

Developing DIY Solar-Powered, Off-Grid Audio Streamers for Forest Soundscapes: Progress and Challenges

**Abstract**

This project presents the ongoing development and challenges of building two permanent listening stations for one year located in the Alice Holt Forest in the UK using DIY practices and techniques:

* **Soundscape**: [http://solid41.streamupsolutions.com:8010/](http://solid41.streamupsolutions.com:8010/)
* **Installation**: [http://solid67.streamupsolutions.com:8063/](http://solid67.streamupsolutions.com:8063/)

## Q&A

The talk was very well received. There were several questions on the manufacturing and replication of the streamers. The questions included: what is the audio quality/range (is it recording beyond what humans can hear?); the cost of producing one streamer (is it an affordable cost?); and how many streamers we are planning to develop. We will soon be releasing the software and hardware details as well as what needs to be changed to improve the sound quality even more under a tight budget.
