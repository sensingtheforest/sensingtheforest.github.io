## About this Tutorial

![birdfeeder](../../src/assets/images/2025/07/birdfeeder.jpg)

In this tutorial, I’ll walk you through the minimal steps to build a **solar-powered home LAN streamer** that can also **automate recordings based on solar time**. We’ll be using the code from [our repository](https://github.com/sensingtheforest/audio-streamer), but if you’d like to modify it for your own projects (and you’re absolutely encouraged to!), check out [this other tutorial](https://sensingtheforest.github.io/streamers/tutorial-3/) for more details — including standalone solutions to some of the most annoying problems we ran into when deploying our streamers in the forest.


## Shopping List

* [ ] Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
* [ ] Micro SD card (any size, we used 256GB but calculate storage needs based on recording time)
* [ ] **Stereo Audio Input Options we tested**:

  * [ ] 2 × MEMS microphones with breakout (no audio interface needed, extremely cheap but low quality)
    **OR**
  * [ ] RØDE AI-Micro + 2 × Lavalier GO (most usb audio devices and lavalier mics will work)

#### Solar Power Setup (optional)
* [ ] 1 × 120W solar panel
* [ ] Battery Charge Controller with 5V USB Output
* [ ] Any standard 12V car battery
