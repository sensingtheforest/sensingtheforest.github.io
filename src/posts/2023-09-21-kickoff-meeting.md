After quietly working on setting up the project during the summer, today, Thursday 21st of September 2023, we have officially started the project with an online kickoff meeting.

We started the meeting by making introductions. We welcomed the new team members Luigi Marino, who has been appointed postdoctoral fellow of the project, as well as Nick Wardlaw and Danielle Grimsey from Forestry England, who have recently joined the project, and Hazel Stone, who has been appointed the National Curator of Contemporary Art at Forestry England. All welcome!

Then, we discussed the overall project and expected outcomes and made some decisions on how to operate as a team. We will soon be announcing a series of six talks by experts working at the intersection of the arts, science and technology, whose work is inspirational and relevant to *Sensing the Forest*.
