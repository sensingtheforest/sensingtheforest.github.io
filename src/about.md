## Vision

*Sensing the Forest* brings an interdisciplinary team of artists and scientists together to work on a timely issue using an original approach to gaining knowledge about the connection between forests and climate change that can have a local, national and global impact. The democratisation of these tools is essential to progress in the field.

## Meet the team

Max's passion has always been in countryside management and finds great joy in starting an ambitious project, managing the works (or issues!) throughout and seeing the end product not only for the benefit of the site and its inhabitants but also the visitors who can enjoy and learn from the project and will go on to share what they have seen or learnt to others. Max has worked at Alice Holt for about 2.5 years now and still has much more to learn from this site with a rich history dating back to the Roman era, and is always looking for ways to tell the site's story in new and interesting ways.

## I hear the jury's still out on science.

Guy's a pro. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Michael! I care deeply for nature. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Across from where?

No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. **Not tricks, Michael, illusions.** _Really?_ Did nothing cancel?

## There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.

No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. That's why you always leave a note! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Steve Holt!

1. Michael!
2. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"
3. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"

### No… but I'd like to be asked!

I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.

- No… but I'd like to be asked!
- Guy's a pro.
- Well, what do you expect, mother?

That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' I hear the jury's still out on science. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Marry me.

No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Well, what do you expect, mother? But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!

No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. No… but I'd like to be asked! I care deeply for nature.
