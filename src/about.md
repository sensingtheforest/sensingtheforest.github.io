## Vision

*Sensing the Forest* brings an interdisciplinary team of artists and scientists together to work on a timely issue using an original approach to gaining knowledge about the connection between forests and climate change that can have a local, national and global impact. The democratisation of these tools is essential to progress in the field.

## Meet the team

[Dr Matthew Wilkinson (CI, Forest Research)](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/staff/matthew-wilkinson/)

Matt Wilkinson is a Senior Climate Scientist at Forest Research. The focus of his research is to improve our understanding of forest carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances and how they may be impacted by management, environmental and climate change. Matt’s particular work focuses on using a combination of surface flux techniques across a range of scales to understand the processes controlling C and GHG cycling within forest ecosystems. In addition to leading several GHG and forest monitoring related projects, he has managed the Straits Flux Research Site within the Alice Holt Research Forest for > ten years. Matt is also interested in developing new techniques and sensors for trace gas flux measurements and forest monitoring. Matt joined Forest Research in 2001. He graduated from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1995 with a BSc (Hons) in Agriculture and the Environment and then obtained an MSc in Crop Production in the Changing Environment in 1996 from the University of Essex. He completed his PhD by Publication at the University of Portsmouth.

[Dr Georgios Xenakis (CI, Forest Research)](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/staff/georgios-xenakis/)

Georgios Xenakis' work focuses on measuring the carbon, water and energy balances of upland Sitka spruce plantations. Using micrometeorological techniques and eco-physiological process-based models, George quantifies the effect forest management has on carbon dynamics. George is also the manager of the Harwood Forest GHG monitoring site. His other research focuses on the drought effect on trees, both on the ecosystem and individual tree scale. George currently leads a manipulation experiment investigating the physiology of young trees during the recovery from drought.

[Professor Mark Plumbley (Professor of Signal Processing, EPSRC Fellow in "AI for Sound", University of Surrey)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/mark-plumbley)

Prof Mark Plumbley's research concerns AI for Sound: using machine learning and signal processing for analysis and recognition of sounds. Mark's focus is on detection, classification and separation of acoustic scenes and events, particularly real-world sounds, using methods such as deep learning, sparse representations and probabilistic models. Mark has published over 400 papers in journals, conferences and books, including over 70 journal papers and the recent Springer co-edited book on Computational Analysis of Sound Scenes and Events. Much of Mark's research is funded by grants from EPSRC and EU, Innovate UK and other sources and currently holds an EPSRC Fellowship on "AI for Sound".

## I hear the jury's still out on science.

Guy's a pro. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Michael! I care deeply for nature. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Across from where?

No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. **Not tricks, Michael, illusions.** _Really?_ Did nothing cancel?

## There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.

No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. That's why you always leave a note! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Steve Holt!

1. Michael!
2. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"
3. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"

### No… but I'd like to be asked!

I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.

- No… but I'd like to be asked!
- Guy's a pro.
- Well, what do you expect, mother?

That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' I hear the jury's still out on science. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Marry me.

No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Well, what do you expect, mother? But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!

No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. No… but I'd like to be asked! I care deeply for nature.
