	"quotefrom": "Ed Chivers",
	"description": "This theme involves the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems. As species disappear and habitats are destroyed, the ecological balance that sustains forests is disrupted, which in turn affects the climate and vice versa."

	"quotefrom": "Alexander Smith",
	"description": "This theme focuses on trees as historical artefacts that are also fragile in the face of modern environmental threats. This perspective acknowledges the longevity and role of trees and can also draw attention to the urgent environmental changes threatening them. Trees can be seen not only as relics of the past but also as symbols of what could be lost if climate change continues progressing."

	"quote2":"As we sense a tree, the city turns into our forest, and the forest becomes our city.",
	"quote2from": "Bardia Hafizi",
	"description": "In this theme, the concept of rhizomatic interconnections is drawn from Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s philosophical framework, described as a non-hierarchical, decentralised way of thinking about systems, communities, and relationships. Here, the emphasis lays on how trees and ecosystems are interconnected in ways that resemble rhizomes, with multiple, non-linear relationships of exchange, support, and communication."

	"description": "In this theme, the human-environment interactions are seen as a mechanism to (re-)connect with the environment and promote environmental consciousness. This theme involves human interaction with nature as a way to raise awareness of ecological concerns such as climate change by interacting with augmented natural systems that can help us interpret the state of forests and the broader environment."
