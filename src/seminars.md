The AHRC Sensing the Forest project is organising a series of three fortnightly online seminar talks with experts related to artistic, social and scientific interventions in the forest or other natural landscapes with a special focus on acoustic phenomena. The seminar series will include talks by Semiconductor, Peter Sinclair, Saloni Shah, Jones/Bulley, Liz O'Brien and Alice Eldridge.

### Semiconductor

#### Worlds in Flux: Semiconductor

Ruth Jarman, one half of artist duo Semiconductor, will give a talk introducing their practice and their approach to using scientific data of the natural world as a medium. Interested in the gap between how science represents the physical world and how we experience it, Semiconductor take scientific data as being a representation of nature and explore how to make this data tangible, using custom digital techniques to convert to audio, animation or 3d forms. She will focus on their two works Cosmos (2014) and Earthworks (2016). Cosmos is a sculpture created using the data from one year’s worth of measurements of the take up and loss of carbon dioxide from the trees in Alice Holt Forest. Earthworks is a multi-screen installation which translates seismic data from glaciers, earthquakes, volcanos and mining activity into audio and animation. Ruth will discuss Semiconductor’s creative process, how they approach research with scientists and within labs, and how they then go on to develop and realise artworks.

Semiconductor is UK artists Ruth Jarman and Joe Gerhardt. Over the past twenty-five years of collaboration they have become known for a unique and innovative body of moving image works, sculptures and installations which explore the material nature of our physical world and how we experience it through the lenses of science and technology. Their works bring into tangible experience that which is outside of what is humanly perceivable, confronting the viewer with information which is ordinarily outside of a human scale, both of time and space. Semiconductor’s works often evolve from intensive periods of research spent in science laboratories and universities. Residencies include the Physics Dept at University of Glasgow (2022 – ongoing); CERN, Geneva; NASA Space Sciences Laboratory; Mineral Sciences Laboratory, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC; and the Charles Darwin Research Station, Galapagos.

<!-- Their artwork Cosmos, commissioned through [Jerwood Open Forest](https://jerwoodopenforest.org/), a partnership between Jerwood Charitable Foundation and Forestry Commission England, is a two-metre spherical wooden sculpture, which was installed in Alice Holt Forest 2014 – 2020. The sculpture was created through translating the data from one year’s worth of measurements of the take up and loss of carbon dioxide from the forest trees into three-dimensional forms. The sculpture reveals the visual patterns and shapes inherent in the data through custom digital techniques. The result is complex interference patterns produced by the waveforms and patterns in the data. These sculptural forms become unreadable within the context of science, yet become a physical form we can see, touch, experience and readable in a new way.

Semiconductor have exhibited their work internationally, selected exhibitions include: Indivisible, [New Media Gallery](https://newmediagallery.ca/), Canada; HALO, John Hansard Gallery, UK (solo show); Semiconductor, The 14th Media Art Biennale Santiago, National Center of Contemporary Arts, (CNAC), Chile (solo show); The Technological Sublime, City Gallery, New Zealand, (solo show); Quantica, CCCB, Spain; HALO, The 4th Audemars Piguet Commission at Art Basel, Switzerland; The View from Nowhere, Le Lieu Unique, France, (solo show); SUPERPOSITION: Equilibrium and Engagement, 21st Biennale of Sydney, Australia 2018. Their works are held in both public and private collections. -->

### Dr Peter Sinclair

#### Locustream Open Microphones - Acoustic commons : a shared resource to renew listening

Locustream Open Microphones is a project dedicated to capturing local soundscapes and transmitting them live via the Internet. Locustream is also a network of people who maintain these microphones and others who use the audio sources they generate for a variety of artistic and scientific purposes. The problem that drives this project, which has been evolving for more than 15 years now, concerns the way in which listening through mediatization (extended remote listening) can modify our perception of and our relationship to the environment.

Peter Sinclair (PhD, HDR) is a Sound Artist and professor of sound art practice at Aix-en Provence Art academy (ESA-Aix). He is internationally renowned for his sound installations as well as for his work on collaborative and participative environments. His artistic experimentations use networked games, mobile media, data sonification and live audio streaming. He is codirector of Locus Sonus Vitae a research group supported by the French Ministry for Culture and ESAAIX.

## I hear the jury's still out on science.

Guy's a pro. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Michael! I care deeply for nature. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Across from where?

No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. **Not tricks, Michael, illusions.** _Really?_ Did nothing cancel?

## There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.

No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. That's why you always leave a note! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Steve Holt!

1. Michael!
2. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"
3. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"

### No… but I'd like to be asked!

I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.

- No… but I'd like to be asked!
- Guy's a pro.
- Well, what do you expect, mother?

That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' I hear the jury's still out on science. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Marry me.

No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Well, what do you expect, mother? But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!

No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. No… but I'd like to be asked! I care deeply for nature.
