## Description

The Sensing the Forest Summer School is here to provide an inclusive educational environment that serves state-of-the-art climate science, installation art, acoustic ecology, and environmental design.

Whether you are a PhD student, advanced MA/MMus/MSc or BA/BMus/BSc student, independent artist, or hobbyist, you're welcome to join our community of learners. There is a limited number of 10 places in the summer school.

With a carefully designed curriculum that combines theory and hands-on sessions, our expert team of lecturers will guide you through 6 online 1h sessions, each dedicated to a different topic: **forest research**, **installation art**, **environmental design**, and **project development**. The summer school will conclude with a 2-day intensive summit, in which your project will be exhibited in the wild and open to the public, as well as have an online presence for one year. Likely, there might be further artistic opportunities to collaborate with Forestry England.

This should be a unique collaborative experience and immersive learning environment where students, lecturers, and the Sensing the Forest team members work together to deliver an efficient and high-quality knowledge transfer and produce a unique experience.
